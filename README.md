# Instructions

Clone this repo, ensure you can run the tests in test_problem0.py

It will be best if you can do this directly through your IDE, so that you can use the interactive debugger 
which will greatly assist you during the interview.

If you don't want to use the debugger, you can also run through the command line:

problem1.py:
```python3 -m unittest test_problem0```

It should output something like this:

```
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK
```
